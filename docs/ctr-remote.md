# Optimize Images with `ctr-remote image optimize`

This doc describes example usages of `ctr-remote image optimize` command for converting images into eStargz.

`ctr-remote images optimize` command (call `ctr-remote` in this doc) enables users to convert an image into eStargz.
This command works on containerd so containerd needs to run on your environment.
So this converts an image stored in containerd and stores the resulting image to containerd.

Because the resulting image is stored to containerd, you can use `ctr-remote image pull` and `ctr-remote image push` commands for pulling/pushing images from/to regstries.
[nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl), Docker-compatible CLI for containerd, allows you to pull/push images using `~/.docker/config.json`.
Various other containerd-based commands like `ctr-remote content get`, `ctr-remote images export` and other `ctr-remote` and `nerdctl` commands can also be used for debugging and inspecting the resulting eStargz image.

The converted eStargz image can be lazily pulled by Stargz Snapshotter which can speed up the container startup.
Because this image is backward compatible to OCI/Docker image, this can be also run by other runtimes that don't support lazy pull (e.g. Docker).

Though lazy pull speeds up the container's startup, it's possible, especially with slow network, that the runtime performance becomes lower because reading files can induce remotely downloading file contents.
For mitigating this, `ctr-remote` also allows to *optimize* the image against the *workload* the image runs.
Here, workload means the configuration of the container that runs from that image, including the entrypoint program, environment variables, user etc.
This optimization is done by baking the information about files that are likely accessed during runtime (called *prioritized files*), to the image.
On runtime, Stargz Snapshotter prefetches these prioritized files before mounting the layer for making sure these files are locally accessible.
This can avoid downloading chunks on every file read and mitigate the runtime performance drawbacks.

For more details about eStargz and its optimization, refer also to [eStargz: Standard-Compatible Extensions to Tar.gz Layers for Lazy Pulling Container Images](/docs/stargz-estargz.md).

## Requirements

- containerd: Release binaries are available on https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases.
- CNI plugins (if network connection is needed during optimization): Release binaries are available on https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins.

`ctr-remote` requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
Rootless execution of this command is still WIP.

For trying the examples described in this doc, you can also use the docker-compose-based demo environment.
You can setup this environment as the following commands.
*Note that this runs privileged containers on your host.*

```
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/script/demo
$ docker-compose build containerd_demo
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker exec -it containerd_demo /bin/bash
(inside container) # ./script/demo/run.sh
```

## Optimizing an image

The following command optimizes an (non-eStargz) image `ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org` (this is a copy of `golang:1.15.3-buster`) and pushes the result eStargz image into `registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz`.
This doesn't append workload-related configuration options (e.g. `--entrypoint`) so this optimizes the image against the default configurations baked to the image e.g. through Dockefile instructions (`ENTRYPOINT`, etc) when building the original image.

```
ctr-remote image pull ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org
ctr-remote image optimize --oci ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz
ctr-remote image push --plain-http registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz
```

When you run `ctr-remote image optimize`, this runs the source image (`ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org`) as a container and profiles all file accesses during the execution.
Then these accessed files are marked as "prioritized" files and will be prefetched on runtime.

You can specify the GZIP compression level the converter should use using the `--estargz-compression-level` flag. The values range from 1-9. If the flag isn't provided, the compression level will default to 9.

A value of 9 indicates the archive will be gzipped with max compression. This will reduce the bytes transferred over the network but increase the CPU cycles required to decompress the payload. Whereas gzip compression value 1 indicates archive will be gzipped with least compression. This will increase the bytes transferred over the network but decreases the CPU cycles required to decompress the payload. This value should be chosen based on the workload and host characteristics.

The following example optimizes an image with a compression level of 1.

```console
# ctr-remote image optimize --oci --estargz-compression-level 1 ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz
```

`--oci` option is highly recommended to add when you create eStargz image.
If the source image is [Docker image](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/image/spec/v1.2.md) that doesn't allow us [content verification of eStargz](/docs/verification.md), `ctr-remote` converts this image into the [OCI starndard compliant image](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/).
OCI image also can run on most of modern container runtimes.

You can lazy-pull this image into other hosts with Stargz Snapshotter.
The following example lazily pulls this image to containerd, using `ctr-remote image rpull` command.

```console
# ctr-remote image rpull --plain-http registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz
fetching sha256:9f9b5a43... application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json
fetching sha256:16debc17... application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json
fetching sha256:a610ec55... application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json
# ctr-remote run --rm -t --snapshotter=stargz registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz test echo hello
hello
```

In the following examples, we omit `ctr-remote image pull` and `ctr-remote image push` from the example.

## Optimizing an image with custom configuration

You can also specify the custom workload configuration that the image is optimized against.
The following example optimizes the image against the workload running `go version` on `/bin/bash`.

```
ctr-remote image optimize --oci \
           --entrypoint='[ "/bin/bash", "-c" ]' --args='[ "go version" ]' \
           ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org \
           registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz-go-version
```

Other options are also available for configuring the workload.

|Option|Description|
---|---
|`--entrypoint`|Entrypoint of the container (in JSON array)|
|`--args`|Arguments for the entrypoint (in JSON array)|
|`--env`|Environment variables in the container|
|`--user`|User name to run the process in the container|
|`--cwd`|Working directory|
|`--period`|The time seconds during profiling the file accesses|
|`-t`or`--terminal`|Attach terminal to the container. This flag must be specified with `-i`|
|`-i`|Attach stdin to the container|

## Mounting files from the host

There are several cases where sharing files from host to the container during optimization is useful.
This includes when we want to optimize an image against building a binary using compilers.

For these use-cases, you can mount files on the hosts to the container using `--mount` option.
The following example optimizes the image against the workload where Go compiler compiles "hello world" program.

First, create the following Go source file at `/tmp/hello.go`.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
     fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

Then you can build it inside the container by bind-mounting the file `/tmp/hello.go` on the host to this container.

```
ctr-remote image optimize --oci \
           --mount=type=bind,source=/tmp/hello.go,destination=/hello.go,options=bind:ro \
           --entrypoint='[ "/bin/bash", "-c" ]' --args='[ "go build -o /hello /hello.go && /hello" ]' \
           ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org \
           registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz-hello-world
```

The syntax of the `--mount` option is compatible to containerd's `ctr` tool and [corresponds to the OCI Runtime Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config.md#mounts).
You need to specify the following key-value pairs with comma separators.

|Field|Description|
---|---
|`type`|The type of the filesystem to be mounted|
|`destination`|The absolute path to the destination mount point in the container|
|`source`|The source of the mount|
|`options`|Mount options (separated by `:`) of the filesystem|

## Enabling CNI-based Networking

You can also gain network connection in the container during optimization, using CNI plugins.
Once you configure CNI plugins on the host, CNI-based networking can be enabled using `--cni` option.

The following example accesses to https://example.com from the container, using `bridge` CNI plugin installed in the demo environment.
```
ctr-remote image optimize --oci \
           --cni \
           --entrypoint='[ "/bin/bash", "-c" ]' \
           --args='[ "curl example.com" ]' \
           ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org \
           registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz-curl
```

If CNI plugins and configurations are installed to locations other than well-known paths (/opt/cni/bin and /etc/cni/net.d), you can tell it to `ctr-remote` using the following options.

|Option|Description|
---|---
|`--cni-plugin-config-dir`|Path to the directory where CNI plugins configurations are stored|
|`--cni-plugin-dir`|Path to the directory where CNI plugins binaries are installed|

By default, `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` are configured as the following.

/etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0		ip6-localnet
ff00::0		ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1		ip6-allnodes
ff02::2		ip6-allrouters
```

/etc/resolv.conf

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

If you want to customize the configuration, the following options are useful.

|Option|Description|
---|---
|`--add-hosts`|Commma-separated list of hosts configuration (formatted as `hostname:IP`) for `/etc/hosts`|
|`--dns-nameservers`|Comma-separated `nameserver` configs added to the container's `/etc/resolv.conf`|
|`--dns-search-domains`|Comma-separated `search` configs added to the container's `/etc/resolv.conf`|
|`--dns-options`|Comma-separated `options` configs added to the container's `/etc/resolv.conf`|

## Other useful features

### Reusing already-converted layers

If the source image is large, its conversion takes accordingly long time.
But you can skip conversion for layers that are already converted to eStargz.
For enabling this feature, add `--reuse` option to `ctr-remote`.

The following example re-converts already converted eStargz image (`ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-esgz`) with `--reuse` feature.

```
ctr-remote image optimize --oci \
           --reuse \
           ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-esgz \
           registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz
```

You will see `ctr-remote` skips converting some layers with printing `copying without conversion` log messages as the following.

```
(... omit ...)
WARN[0036] reusing "sha256:4416ecf7e2787af750fe3b1988f36a2c47edc2d3162739c6eedd739d6d5a14d1" without conversion

(... omit ...)
```

When optimizing an image, `ctr-remote` tries to avoid layer conversion as much as possible.
The layers that meet the following conditions are skipped to converting.

- layers that are already formatted as eStargz
- layers that no file access occurred during optimization

### Converting multi-platform images

You can also convert multi-platform images.
If you want to convert all images contained in a multi-platform image, use `--all-platform` option.
If you want to convert an image corresponding to a specific platform, tell it using `--platform` option.
The format of the `--platform` option is `<os>|<arch>|<os>/<arch>[/<variant>]`, please refer to containerd's [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/containerd/containerd/platforms#hdr-Platform_Specifiers) for more details.

The following example converts all images contained in `ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org`.

```
ctr-remote image optimize --oci \
           --all-platforms \
           ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-org \
           registry2:5000/golang:1.15.3-esgz-fat
```

By default, when the source image is a multi-platform image, `ctr-remote` converts the image corresponding to the platform where `ctr-remote` runs.

Note that though the images specified by `--all-platform` and `--platform` are converted to eStargz, images that don't correspond to the current platform aren't *optimized*. That is, these images are lazily pulled but without prefetch.
